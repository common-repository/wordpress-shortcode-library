WordPress Shortcode Library is a small collection of useful shortcodes.

== Description ==

Currently there are 5 active shortcodes in the library: (See Changelog for updates!)

[CF_STREAM/]
Let's you embed CloudFlare Stream videos easily into WordPress posts and pages, with just the video ID. e.g:

[CF_STREAM id="mycloudflarevideoid" preload controls /]

[SITENAME/]
This will create a piece of HTML is your WordPress site title wrapped in a SPAN with ID "siteBrandName"
You can also change the ID by using ID="yourOwnID"

[NOSC] ... [/NOSC]
Short for "No Shortcode". Any shortcodes present within this shortcode are ignored. Useful for writing *about* shortcodes without
them being interpreted.

[HTMLDIV] ... [/HTMLDIV]
You can add a DIV element with parameters:
class=""
id=""
style=""

plugin as it hadn't been updated in several years.

= 1.5 =
* Added a new shortcode: [SITENAME]. This will output your WordPress site name in a SPAN with default ID "brandedSiteName".
You change the ID and also add "class" and "style" as you wish. This shortcode is useful so that if you decide to
alter the name of your site later, and you've used this shortcode throughout, it will automatically update across
your site! You can apply a consistent style for your site name text throughout the site by referencing the ID.
I started using it here: [Kick Start Valencia](http://www.kickstartvalencia.com/ "Kick Start Valencia: Start Living in Valencia")
